# Scala Generic Method Bug

This repository demonstrates a common bug in Scala involving generic methods and incorrect return values. The `myMethod` in `MyClass` always returns the value of the first object, regardless of the intended logic.  The solution corrects this by appropriately using the generic type parameter and applying the intended operation.
